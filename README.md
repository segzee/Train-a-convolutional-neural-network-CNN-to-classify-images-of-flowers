# Flower Image Classifier
This project is a part of the Udacity AI Programming with Python Nanodegree. The goal of this project is to train an image classifier using a deep learning model to recognize different species of flowers. The trained classifier can be integrated into applications, such as a smartphone app that identifies flowers through the device's camera.

# Getting Started
To get started with this project, you need to follow the steps outlined below.

# Prerequisites
Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python
PyTorch
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Pandas
PIL
tqdm
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/flower-image-classifier.git
cd flower-image-classifier
Install the required Python packages:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

assets: Contains assets such as images or diagrams.
data: Holds the dataset, split into training, validation, and testing sets.
Image Classifier Project.ipynb: Jupyter notebook with the main project code.
predict.py: Python script for making predictions using the trained model.
train.py: Python script for training the image classifier.
README.md: The documentation you are currently reading.
Usage
Follow the steps below to run the image classifier:

Open the Jupyter notebook Image Classifier Project.ipynb.
Execute each cell in the notebook to train the image classifier and evaluate its performance.
Once trained, you can use the predict.py script to make predictions on new images.

# Project Overview
The project is divided into the following main steps:

Load and preprocess the image dataset: The dataset consists of 102 flower categories. Images are loaded and preprocessed using torchvision transformations.

Build and train the classifier: A pre-trained VGG16 network is used as the base, and a new classifier is defined and trained on the flower dataset.

Validate the model: The model's performance is evaluated on a validation set to ensure its effectiveness.

Test the network: The final step involves testing the trained network on a separate test set to measure its accuracy on new, unseen images.

Save the checkpoint: The trained model, along with necessary information like class-to-index mapping, is saved as a checkpoint for future use.

Inference for classification: A function is provided to make predictions on new images using the trained model.
